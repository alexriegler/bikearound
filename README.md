# BikeAround
[Getaround](https://www.getaround.com/) but for bikes!

This application combines different types of activities to allow a user to select a bike from a gallery, look at its details, and proceed to a checkout. The checkout calculates a total cost and integrates some of the Plaid API to authenticate a credit card.

This Android application was made at DemonHacks 2019. Many thanks to the sponsors!
